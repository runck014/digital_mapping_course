# Map Hacking -- Digital Mapping for Impact

## Description

Digital maps can change the world. They tell stories that can affect the direction of cities, states, business, countries, and the lives of individuals who use geo-technologies day-to-day. But how do you make these maps and get them into the hands of the people who need the information? This course gives students practical skills in neocartography – the process of map-making by hacking consumer web-based geotechnologies – and illustrates the way geotechnology is embedded at the intersection of technology and society using the theories of socio-technical systems and change.

By the end of this course, you will have the foundational skills required to quickly gather, store, and analyze data, and share maps to tell compelling spatial stories. You don’t need to be an expert in geospatial technology to make powerful digital maps. Whether you’re an ecologist, activist, planner, journalist, nonprofit or business leader, this class will show you how to hack maps for impact.



## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.	Describe and analyze the way geotechnologies are at the intersection of technology and society across multiple industries (such as agriculture, environmental services, logistics) and sociocultural activities (ranging from activism, athletics to art)
2.	Use consumer geotechnologies for data collection, such as cell phone apps, low-cost sensors, smart watches, ArcGIS’s Survey123
3.	Store data on common geospatial cloud platforms such as ArcOnline and Google MyMaps
4.	Perform map-making using basic cartographic principles and spatial analysis
5.	Create maps that tell a clear spatial story across multiple geographic scales 
6.	Share maps and dialogue with other people using maps over social media channels such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and/or TikTok
